# Description
We had to create a sql database in ruby ​​programming language in this project. We can change every information in this database, add new ones and print it through any search method.

# Task
To implement this project we used ruby ​​programming language as mentioned above, the program consists of two code files, my_sqlite_cli.rb and my_sqlite_request.rb. The first of them is made in the form of a command receiving prompt, and the second takes received commands and divides them into different commands and performs various operations between the database

# Usage
Special commands are required to use this program, for example 'SELECT', 'INSERT', 'DELETE' and 'UPDATE' commands. We can tell what these commands do by their name, but the most important thing is to type the command without any errors.

# Installation
To use this project, simply compile the ruby ​​file by typing 'ruby my_sqlite_cli.rb' in the terminal
